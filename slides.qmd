## Why track dependencies

::: fragment
-   You want your code [still to run in 2 years]{.blue}
    - Functionality change; bugfixes
::: 

:::fragment
-   A project might depend on the [specific version]{.blue} of a package
    - Other projects could use newer versions
:::

::: fragment
-   Make your tools [portable]{.blue}
    -   For yourself
    -   For your co-authors
:::


## The [high-level]{.blue} idea

| DIY Project | R/Python Project |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 🏪 Hardware store | Repository (CRAN, PyPI) |
| 🗄 The storage shelf in your garage | The folder with Python/R libraries |
| 🧰 Toolboxes (the drill box, the box of screwdrivers) | Packages (ggplot2, etc.) |
| 🪑 Workbench | Environment: `renv`, `venv` |

## The environment is an [isolated workspace with all tools]{.blue}

::: fragment
-   An environment is defined by a file with [metadata]{.blue} on
    -   Which packages, which versions, from where
    -   From where (repository, github)
:::

::: fragment
-   Metadata are stored in [requirements and lock files]{.blue}
    -   $\Rightarrow$ Recreate the dependencies in the same way
:::

::: fragment
-   This metadata should be under [version control]{.blue}
    -   So that you can track changes and share with others
:::

# R: Using `renv`
:::

## Create a new project in RStudio

::: fragment
1.  Install `renv` globally with

``` r
install.packages("renv")
```
:::

::: fragment
2.  Create new project with version control (git)\
    (File -\> New Project -\> Version Control -\> Git)
:::

::: fragment
3.  Open the project in a new session
:::

## Install and track packages with `renv`

::: fragment
4.  Attach `renv` to your R session with

``` r
library(renv)
```
:::

::: fragment
5.  Initialize the renv

``` r
renv::init(bare = TRUE)
```
:::

:::: fragment
::: incremental
This creates

-   `renv/` -- A new folder that serves as the [**library**]{.blue} of packages for your project.
-   `.Rprofile` -- This file makes sure that once `renv` is turned on for a project, it stays on.
:::
::::

## Create lock file to log project state

``` r
renv::snapshot()
```

yields something like

::: fragment
``` json
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "4.4.2",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://cloud.r-project.org"
      }
    ]
  },
  "Packages": {
      "rlang": {
      "Package": "rlang",
      "Version": "1.1.4",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Requirements": [
        "R",
        "utils"
      ],
      "Hash": "3eec01f8b1dee337674b2e34ab1f9bc1"
    }
  }
}
```
:::

## The lock file records dependencies [only when used in scripts]{.blue}

::: fragment
1.  Install new packages with

``` r
renv::install(dplyr)
```
:::

::: fragment
2.  Use it in a script

``` r
library(dplyr) # or require(dplyr)
```
:::

::: fragment
3.  Update lock file

``` r
renv::snapshot()
```
:::

# Python: Using `venv` and `pip`

## Overview

-   PyPI is the [Python Package Index]{.blue}, the analogue to R's CRAN
    -   But CRAN reviews submissions while PyPI does not
-   `pip` is the Python [package manager]{.blue} and interacts with PyPI
    -   Other tools do the same job
-   `pip` + `venv` are available by default for Python 3.3+

## Getting started

```{=html}
<br/><br/> 
```

::: fragment
Use the command line: a terminal or from an IDE (VS Code)
:::

```{=html}
<br/><br/> 
```

::: fragment
Make sure you can invoke Python

``` bash
$ python3 --version # on Mac/Linux
$ python --version # on Windows — Windows installation comes with a python.exe file rather than a python3.exe file 
```
:::

## Creating the virtual environment

::: fragment
Run

``` bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
```
:::

:::: fragment
::: incremental
What does this do?

-   Creates a folder `venv` to which packages are installed
-   (The `-m` flag calls the `main` part of the `venv` module)
:::
::::

:::: fragment
Activate the virtual environment

::: panel-tabset
## Windows

``` powershell
$ source venv/Scripts/activate
(venv) $
```

## Mac/Linux

``` bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $
```
:::
::::

## Install packages with pip

::: fragment
Run

``` bash
(venv) $ python3 -m pip install numpy
(venv) $ python3 -m pip install matplotlib
```

```{=html}
<br/><br/> 
```
:::

::: fragment
To display information about some installed packages

``` bash
(venv) $ python3 -m pip show numpy
```
:::

::: fragment
To display information about all installed packages

``` bash
(venv) $ python3 -m pip list
```
:::

## Creating `requirements.txt` files

::: fragment

``` bash
(venv) $ python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
:::

::: fragment
We can [inspect]{.blue} the file

``` bash
(venv) $ cat requirements.txt
```

``` output
contourpy==1.2.0
cycler==0.12.1
fonttools==4.45.0
kiwisolver==1.4.5
matplotlib==3.8.2
numpy==1.26.2
packaging==23.2
Pillow==10.1.0
pyparsing==3.1.1
python-dateutil==2.8.2
six==1.16.0
```
:::

::: fragment
[Restore]{.blue} an environment from `requirements.txt`

``` bash
(venv) $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
:::

## PyPI vs conda

:::fragment
| PyPI | conda |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| [Easy to use & create packages]{.green} | [Not only Python, can use external libraries]{.green} |
| [Does not track Python version]{.red} | [Tracks Python version]{.green} |
| [Complicated with external libraries]{.red} | [Heavy -- use miniconda/mamba; packaging is harder]{.red} |
:::

:::fragment
... And try to [keep them apart]{.blue} whenever possible
:::

::: {.section .transition-slide}
# Conclusion
:::

## Good practices

:::fragment
-   Have the environment [inside your project directory]{.blue}
:::

:::fragment
-   When adding new dependencies, [do not pin versions]{.green}:

``` bash
# prefer
(venv) $ python3 -m pip install numpy
# over
(venv) $ python3 -m pip install numpy==1.26.2
```
:::

:::fragment
-   But [keep track of exact versions]{.red} in lock file and commit often
    -   Share with your co-authors
:::

## Other considerations

:::fragment
-   Adding dependencies is always a [make-or-buy]{.blue} decision
    -   Don't reinvent the wheel?
:::

:::fragment
-   [Before adding dependencies]{.blue}, it's good to
    -   Consider different tools for the task
    -   Does it [work as intended]{.blue}?
    -   Check if they are [maintained]{.blue} and the size of the user base
:::

:::fragment
-   Be aware of [security risks]{.blue}
    -   [PyTorch vulnerability](https://johnstawinski.com/2024/01/11/playing-with-fire-how-we-executed-a-critical-supply-chain-attack-on-pytorch/), [ML models may execute arbitrary code](https://jfrog.com/blog/data-scientists-targeted-by-malicious-hugging-face-ml-models-with-silent-backdoor/)

## Hands-on: ideas


-   Start using an environment for an existing project
-   Play around in a dummy project
    -   If you're using `pip` or `conda`, try the other, or try `uv`
